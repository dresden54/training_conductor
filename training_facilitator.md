# Welcome to the facilitator training
![Logo](/pictures/conductor.jpg)
This training will teach you how to be an efficient MLMBSC Facilitator. This is one of the best role in MLMBSC because you are the nice guy that everybody like and still slack off. This training will teach you how to be the nice friend of the team but still be efficent enough to deliver the project without doing anything on your side except push the people to work to their death.

## Good cop
### Why 
* Several studies show that people will form strong bonds together when sharing a common enemy and thus will work better together [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/words-matter/201812/do-we-need-common-enemy].
* Build trust [https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-trust-work-according-salesforce-svp-landing-page-l8-2020?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds]
### How
* Side with the team against the MLMBSC conductor. Tell them he is an ass***** that don't even understand how important they are and that you will not hesitate to fight against the conductor to help them. In reality it's just for the show. You will be the one adding fuel on the fire to come and extinguish it after and look like a nice guy.
* Food !! and drinks ! Developers are simple people and you will squeeze them more with this simple trick. It's an old recipe [https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2018/05/24/why-do-companies-like-google-and-facebook-offer-free-food/#405d4b19282b] but quite efficient. Even if you can not expense them it is worth using your own fund to buy some pizza to ensure employee stay longer and finish the project....It is in your interested to have the project deliver so you can do another one after and continue to slack off(You slalary - pizza cost > no salary)

* Love ! You need to be the nice guy so that people like you and work their ass up for you. DEVs working in a 10k employee making billions every year will not feel as engaged as if they have a face in front of them. If you manage to establish a connection to them you will have them work to death. You should have a connection strong enough to motivate them to rush Area51 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Area_51]. "Do you think you could try to finish XXX tonight ? It's really important for YYY to be able to do ZZZ".
