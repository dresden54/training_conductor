# Welcome to the administrator training
Congratulations ! You just manage to get a fake job. 
 
MLMBSC never intended to have an "administrator" position. It was originally created for 2 main reasons
* Cost reduction during hard times. 
Imagine your company does not want to implement MLMBSC because of the cost of all these new positions that may look useless because they don't produce anything (in some companies people are smart and notice MLMBSC don't really produce anything real)... MLMBSC evangelist and conductor can propose to reduce costs by adding the duties of administrator to the conductor and thus skip the Administrator position for the project.
Will that add too much work to the Conductor ? No because X + 0 = X... but officially "he it will but the Conductor is highly motivated to work on this project and will do it"
* Scapegoat for project failure
In case the project fails for any reason - This should not happen - you need to put some of the blame on the bad MLMBSC implementation. It will uncorrelate MLMBSC of the failure to prevent any brand damage. 
 
It is still possible that you end up in a big fat company (fat finance company that decided to start doing IT because they are afraid of google wallet) that invest massively and thus go with MLMBSC without regards to cost and create this position. If that's the case don't worry and just go with the flow

You are like Batman when he sees the bat signal....as soon as you see a meeting related to MLMBSC you pop out of nowhere to see if the MLMBSC methodology is properly followed.

## Ensure MLMBSC methodology is well applied
You are covering several projects to make sure the MLMBSC methodology is properly followed. In other way you will have nothing to do since MLMBSC members know what to do.
 
### Why
Because you need an official reason to justify your position and salary. We also need to be sure MLMBSC members are doing their jobs (especially the conductor) and put enough useless meetings for all MLMBSC members.
 
### How
* Be sure your calendar is always full. It means the different MLMBSC Conductors of the different projects you work on are doing their job.
