![Logo](/pictures/conductor.jpg)
This training will teach you how to be an efficient MLMBSC Conductor. You will learn how this ungrateful role plays out in MLMBSC Framework. Nobody will like you but you don't care since you can slack off 95% of the time when others are sweating their ass to deliver the project for which you will get all the awards.

## Bad cop
### Why 
* Several studies show that people will form strong bonds together when sharing a common enemy and thus will work better together [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/words-matter/201812/do-we-need-common-enemy].
### How
* Remember when the Night Watch all united to go stab Jon Snow…. Be like Jon. Don't worry even if your team stab you, you will be reborn.

## Organize (but don t deliver)
### Why
* Meetings are fun and a good way to spend time before going /lunch/home. Don't forget to invite other MLMBSC memebers... We all enjoy doing nothing.
* A calendar full is a good signal sent to your management. Don’t forget to put your calendar in public so everybody sees how busy your job is.
* Demo meetings allow you to demo the work done by others to the management making you like a productive employee. There is no shame in stealing the work of others. You are the spiritual reincarnation of Thomas Edison.

### How
* Ensure that minimal actions/minutes are done during these meetings. You master the art of delivering empty memo/minutes to the management to validate why MLMBSC was needed
* Invite other MLMBSC members in these meetings. It will allow them to justify their salary and have people present. Not only will it make the meeting impressive for your superior (we were 30 people working on it) but it will also allow other MLMBSC members in your organisation to slack off for a few hours.
