This training will teach you how to be an efficient MLMBSC Conductor. You will learn how this ungrateful role plays out in MLMBSC Framework. Nobody will like you but you don't care since you can slack off 95% of the time when others are sweating their ass to deliver the project for which you will get all the awards.
