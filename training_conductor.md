# Welcome to the conductor training
![Logo](/pictures/conductor.jpg)
This training will teach you how to be an efficient MLMBSC Conductor. You will learn how this ungrateful role plays out in MLMBSC Framework. Nobody will like you but you don't care since you can slack off 95% of the time when others are sweating their ass to deliver the project for which you will get all the awards.

## Bad cop
### Why 
* Several studies show that people will form strong bonds together when sharing a common enemy and thus will work better together [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/words-matter/201812/do-we-need-common-enemy].
### How
* Remember when the Night Watch all united to go stab Jon Snow…. Be like Jon. Don't worry even if your team stab you, you will be reborn.

## Organize (but don t deliver)
### Why
* Meetings are fun and a good way to spend time before going /lunch/home. Don't forget to invite other MLMBSC members... We all enjoy doing nothing.
* A calendar full is a good signal sent to your management. Don’t forget to put your calendar in public so everybody sees how busy your job is.
* Demo meetings allow you to demo the work done by others to the management making you like a productive employee. There is no shame in stealing the work of others. You are the spiritual reincarnation of Thomas Edison.
 
### How
* Ensure that minimal actions/minutes are done during these meetings. You master the art of delivering empty memo/minutes to the management to validate why MLMBSC was needed and how well the project is on track
* Invite other MLMBSC members in these meetings. It will allow them to justify their salary and have people present. Not only will it make the meeting impressive for your superior (we were 30 people working on it) but it will also allow other MLMBSC members in your organisation to slack off for a few hours.

## Project (confusing) graph
### Why
* Management need to know that everything is going smooth 
 
### How
* bad scale
* Colors
  * Your company probably has some kind of corporate color palette which will be composed of 2 or 3 main colors with small variations around them with 5 small variations of the main colors. Use this to deliver unreadable graphs like

  * For people not working on big company where money is spend on branding you may think it's not possible to be that stupid? Let me share with you this real world example of a company which has a main yellow color as part of their brand. You should really try a big fat company....you will be shocked how budgets could be wasted... hopefully for MLMBSC ;)

  * Don't save the planet and print it...in black and white. Do that before the meeting and look like you just discover it too and blame your company "Save the planet" program with "What ? the remove color from printer with the new DO NOT PRINT program...shit...i will send you the original by email after the meeting"

# FAQ
## What if the project fails ?
If the project fails you failed! What did you do wrong ? Did you not identify the high contributor in the team to make sure he delivers in time ?
Don't worry too much you can still save your ass and more importantly MLMBSC (Nobody really care about your ass)
* Bad project implementation due to not following MLMBSC standard implementation. Did you had a MLMBSC Administrator in your MLMBSC team for this project? That's why
* Maybe you are lucky and someone on your team left the company during the project?
* Blaming the whole team because they are losers? Don't try that. It will not work an the fault will be put on you and facilitator and thus undermine MLMBSC credibility
* Blame it on internal fights between divisions. The project was probably involving several divisions with different directors with existing tensions. Turn them on each others using these existing tensions.
* Just google "why IT project fails" and you will find plenty of possible list of excuses like [https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/03/31/14-common-reasons-software-projects-fail-and-how-to-avoid-them/#fb28022798c9] Pick the one that could apply in your case. 
## What if someone in the team suggest that I do real work ?
