# Welcome to the MLMBSC basic training
![Logo](/pictures/basic_training.jpg)
This training will teach you the basic of MLMBSC methodology.
 
So you decided it was time for you to enjoy a free careless life of slacking. It's fine to slack off... [even ants do it](https://www.sciencealert.com/many-worker-ants-are-actually-lazy-slackers-but-there-s-a-good-reason-for-that)
 
 
# Training prerequisite
## Time
You need to block 4 hours for this training free of other distractions.
 
We suggest to use these 4 hours with the following planing:
* training: 5 minutes
* movie: 90 minutes
* shopping: 30 minutes
* cooking: 90 minutes
 
## Materials needed for training

Like any methodology training you will need some spaghetti and marshmallow. Don't forget to expense them as it is mandatory for this training.
 
You can screenshot the previous line for expense purposes...and then go do your shopping to buy them. You should also buy the following:
* 1lb ground beef
* 1/2 lb ground Italian sausage mild or spicy to taste
* garlic
* 1 medium onion 
* 1green bell pepper 
* 1 celery Stalk
* oregano
* 10 large bottle of red wine(the recipe say 1 small but life is short)
* 1 15 oz. Can Italian stewed tomatoes
* 1 6 oz. Can tomato paste
* 2 15 oz. Cans tomato sauce
* sugar
* olive oil
* instant Cappuccino preparation
 
 
Roast the marshmallow and use a spaghetti to put them on top of cappuccino like the picture below

Save the rest of spaghetti for dinner. You can cook some [good Bolognese] (https://foodal.com/recipes/pasta/perfect-spaghetti/) This is not an affiliate link or a sponsor of any kind for foodal. I have high respect for you  and would not do that (and they refuse to give me money to promote them...).
 
## Project organisation

### Team Organisation
 
#### Team size
You need to keep the size of the team to a minimum to keep better control on the ressources but not too small since there are already almost 3 useless ressources due to the framework. We suggest a team of 6 or 7 people with at least one MLMBSC Conductor and one MLMBSC Facilitator. The MLMBSC Evangelist can join several teams and is not attached to a specific project.
 
If the project is too big you need to scale horizontally by adding more teams. This will allow more MLMBSC members to join and more slacking for our big family.
 
### Team structure
MLMBSC members in the team do not really contribute to anything and are just here to slack off and get the awards. The rest of the team will do the work... In the "rest of the team" you may have a high performance ressource. It is very important to identify such resources since they will be very valuable and probably contribute to 80% of the "rest of the team work". It is an [established fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) so don't worry and just use that to slack off more.

It is possible that this high performer has a bad attitude and consider a [high performer with bad attitude](https://dandoadvisors.com/brilliant-jerks/). You need to understand that the only reason for such an attitude is that the resource is just pissed off not to be able to do what he likes (probably development) but spend his time in useless meetings or explaining how to "hello world" to other team members. It is very important that you make sure that the high performer member of the team can focus on work !

Do not bother him with the fake meeting (they are only for you and MLMBSC to slack off) and prevent other team members from bothering him.
