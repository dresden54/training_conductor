# Welcome to the MLMBSC basic training
![Logo](/pictures/basic_training.jpg)
This training will teach you the basic of MLMBSC methodology.
 
So you decided it was time for you to enjoy a free careless life of meetings.
 
## Project organisation

### Team size
You need to keep the size of the team to a minimum to keep better control on the ressources but not too small since there are already almost 3 useless ressources due to the framework. We suggest a team of 6 or 7 people with at least one MLMBSC Conductor and one MLMBSC Facilitator. The MLMBSC Evangelist can join several teams and is not attached to a specific project.
 
If the project is too big you need to scale horizontally by adding more teams. This will allow more MLMBSC members to join and more slacking for our big family.
