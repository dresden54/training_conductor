# Welcome to the MLMBSC basic training

This training will teach you the basic of MLMBSC methodology.
 
So you decided it was time for you to enjoy a free careless life of slacking. It's fine to slack off... even ants do it [https://www.sciencealert.com/many-worker-ants-are-actually-lazy-slackers-but-there-s-a-good-reason-for-that]
 
## Project organisation

### Team Organisation
 
#### Team size
You need to keep the size of the team to a minimum to keep better control on the ressources but not too small since there are already almost 3 useless ressources due to the framework. We suggest a team of 6 or 7 people with at least one MLMBSC Conductor and one MLMBSC Facilitator. The MLMBSC Evangelist can join several teams and is not attached to a specific project.
 
If the project is too big you need to scale horizontally by adding more teams. This will allow more MLMBSC members to join and more slacking for our big family.
 
### Team structure
MLMBSC members in the team do not really contribute to anything and are just here to slack off and get the awards. The rest of the team will do the work... In the "rest of the team" you may have a high performance ressource. It is very important to identify such resources since they will be very valuable and probably contribute to 80% of the "rest of the team work". It is an established fact [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle] so don't worry and just use that to slack off more.

It is possible that this high performer has a bad attitude and consider a "high performer with bad attitude" [https://dandoadvisors.com/brilliant-jerks/]. You need to understand that the only reason for such an attitude is that the resource is just pissed off not to be able to do what he likes (probably development) but spend his time in useless meetings or explaining how to "hello world" to other team members. It is very important that you make sure that the high performer member of the team can focus on work !

Do not bother him with the fake meeting (they are only for you and MLMBSC to slack off) and prevent other team members from bothering him.
